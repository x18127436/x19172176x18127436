Initially, the intention was to create a centralized restaurant reservation system web application. 
However, as the project progressed, the decision was made to create where users can schedule and pay for individual counselling sessions with a 
medically trained professional instead.

Midway through the project, my partner withdrew from the course and the workload doubled as a result.

The project itself was challenging but overall, it was an enjoyable and worthwhile experience.
